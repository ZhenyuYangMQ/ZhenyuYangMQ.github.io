Graphs have a superior ability to represent relational data, like chemical compounds, proteins, and social networks. Hence, graph-level learning, which takes a set of graphs as input, has been applied to many tasks including comparison, regression, classification, and more. Traditional approaches to learning a set of graphs tend to rely on hand-crafted features, such as substructures. But while these methods benefit from good interpretability, they often suffer from computational bottlenecks as they cannot skirt the graph isomorphism problem. Conversely, deep learning has helped graph-level learning adapt to the growing scale of graphs by extracting features automatically and decoding graphs into low-dimensional representations. As a result, these deep graph learning methods have been responsible for many successes. Yet, there is no comprehensive survey that reviews graph-level learning starting with traditional learning and moving through to the deep learning approaches. This article fills this gap and frames the representative algorithms into a systematic taxonomy covering traditional learning, graph-level deep neural networks, graph-level graph neural networks, and graph pooling. To ensure a thoroughly comprehensive survey, the evolutions, interactions, and communications between methods from four different branches of development are also examined. This is followed by a brief review of the benchmark data sets, evaluation metrics, and common downstream applications. The survey concludes with 13 future directions of necessary research that will help to overcome the challenges facing this booming field.
